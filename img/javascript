I’d love to help you build that kind of learning experience! While I can’t create or export a downloadable PDF file, I can absolutely lay out a detailed roadmap and an interactive checklist right here in chat — like your personal professor guiding you step by step. You can copy it into your notes or use Copilot Pages to organize and expand it into your own study guide.

• Loops: `for`, `while`
• Functions: declaration vs arrow functions
• Scope: global vs local


Project:

• Build a number guessing game
• Add a reset button using HTML + JS


Homework:

• Write a function that returns the square of a number
• Create a loop that prints numbers 1–10


Quiz:
